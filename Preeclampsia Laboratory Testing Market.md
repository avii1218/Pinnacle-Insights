One major application is the routine screening of pregnant women during their prenatal visits. These tests are essential for identifying risk factors early, allowing for timely interventions that can significantly improve maternal and fetal outcomes. Advances in laboratory technology have enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of these tests, making them crucial for effective management of preeclampsia. The market for screening applications is growing as more healthcare providers adopt these tests to ensure comprehensive prenatal care and to reduce the incidence of severe complications associated with preeclampsia.</p><p>Another prominent application within the preeclampsia laboratory testing market is the diagnostic testing performed after the initial screening. Diagnostic tests are employed to confirm the presence of preeclampsia in patients who have screened positive or exhibit symptoms. These tests typically include measurements of biomarkers, such as serum levels of placental growth factor and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, which are critical for definitive diagnosis. The market for diagnostic applications is expanding due to the increasing prevalence of preeclampsia and the rising demand for precise diagnostic tools. This growth is further fueled by ongoing research and development aimed at improving test accuracy and patient outcomes in the management of preeclampsia.</p></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Preeclampsia Laboratory Testing Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>PerkinElmer Inc.</Li><Li> F.
